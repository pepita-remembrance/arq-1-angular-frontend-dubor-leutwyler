# Run it locally

First of all you'll need to run `npm install && npm run postinstall` to generate the dist directory.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Or also you can do `npm start` and then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.

##### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

##### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
